# We're SaberJS ðŸ‘‹
---
## ðŸ¤” Owo. What is this?
This is the official organization for [SaberJS](https://saberjs.dev). Here you will find our main package, SaberJS (an upcoming discord library), and many other side projects, such as any open source bots, made by the developers of this library, for you to view how it works.

## ðŸŒ± Awesome. What is this library for?
This library, made by previous users of [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/), is made for users who seek steady and maintainable code. Our library will pack many things, many libraries do not support, such as clusters within the sharding, optional caching (low cache as default), and many more to come!

### ðŸŽ“ This library is maintained by 6 different developers.
Our developers are each proficient in Javascript, and Typescript. You can rest assured that updates and fixes will be pushed out rapidly.
